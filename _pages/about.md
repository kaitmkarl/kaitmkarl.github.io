I am a PhD student and conservation biologist located at the Illinois Natural History Survey, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research broadly focuses on how Anthropogenic changes, such as habitat loss, climate change, and disease, are shaping the survival and evolution of threatened species. 

I possess a deep fascination with all biodiversity, though I am especially drawn to herpetofauna (rattlesnakes in particular), as well as birds, parasites, and invertebrate species. My doctoral research project focuses on the conservation genomics and disease ecology of the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), a long-lived pitviper of eastern North American forests.

My experience spans both laboratory and field settings. I have studied parasite diversity in Peruvian frogs, worked to untangle the phylogenetics of gartersnakes, and tracked the movements of threatened Bird-voiced Treefrogs in the swamps of southern Illinois. My current projects include investigating how climate variability affects the phenology of Western Diamondback Rattlesnakes in the Arizona-Sonora Desert and describing several novel parasite species infecting reptiles and amphibians.

Art has always been central to how I engage with wildlife. Since childhood, Iâ€™ve kept illustrated field journals that document the wildlife I observe. As a teenager, I began using art as a tool for conservation, donating my paintings to nonprofit auctions and raising over $20,000 to support rattlesnake conservation efforts. You can view my scientific illustration portfolio and rattlesnake artwork [Portfolio](https://kaitmkarl.github.io/portfolio/).

Now, as a PhD student, I aim to integrate ecological fieldwork, genomics, and science communication to protect the species that first inspired me. Through research, art, and outreach, I strive to bridge the gap between people and the biodiversity we share our world with.
