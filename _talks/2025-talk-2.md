Long-term studies of individual organisms are critical for understanding movement patterns, behavior, and responses to environmental change. Despite their relevance, longitudinal field studies of long-lived reptiles remain limited, especially in the context of shifting climatic conditions. Here, we examined the seasonal movements of a population of Western Diamondback Rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) in the Suizo Mountains of southern Arizona over a decade (2001â€“2010). Specifically, we investigated the seasonal timing of ingress and egress (the entry and exit from winter shelters) in relation to daily temperature and precipitation. We employed a time-series analysis to assess how the timing of seasonal movement may reflect broader behavioral and phenological responses to shifting climatic conditions, particularly in the context of ongoing drought in the Arizona-Sonora Desert.
